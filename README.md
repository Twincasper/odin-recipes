This is the first project in the newly updated foundations portion of the odin project, and my first personal project in quite some time. It is a recipes project that serves as a good practice/application of creating a html boilerplate on a homepage, creating links to other webpages on that homepage and consequently actually creating content on those webpages using headings, images, lists and paragraphs.
